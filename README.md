### Objective
Build graphical representations of a road transportation network to support network optimization studies.

### Introduction
For a retailer, road transportation between the distribution centre and stores represents a major part of the logistics costs.Â 
Companies often conduct route planning optimization studies to reduce these costs and improve the efficiency of their network.

It requires **collaboration** between continuous improvement engineers and the transportation teams that manage operations on a daily basis.

### Article
In this Article, we will use Graph Theory to design visual representations of a transportation network to support this collaboration and facilitate solution design.

### Scenario
As a **continuous improvement engineer** of a retail company, you are in charge of the reengineering of warehousing and transportation operations. In your scope, you have a major distribution centre located in Shanghai (China) that delivers **54 hypermarkets**.

#### Objective
Your objective is to reduce the total cost of transportation.

#### Insights: Cost per Ton
The objective is to design  a new transportation plan to increase the average size of trucks by delivering more stores per route.

#### Solution: Graph Theory
A graph is a structure that contains nodes (stores) and each of the related pairs of nodes is called an edge.

#### Further Analysis
With these graphs you can challenge the current routing and discuss about optimization levers with the transportation teams.
